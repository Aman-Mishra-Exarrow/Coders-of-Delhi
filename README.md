# Coders-of-Delhi
Coders of Delhi is a data-driven recommendation engine built using Python and essential data science techniques. It analyzes community data to provide personalized suggestions such as "People You May Know", "Pages You May Like", and ensures high-quality insights through robust data cleaning.

🚀 Project Overview
The project simulates a social networking platform tailored for coders in Delhi. By using real-world-inspired data and applying data science techniques, this project demonstrates how meaningful connections and content recommendations can be generated from raw data.

📌 Key Features
1. 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 People You May Know
Uses collaborative filtering and common connections.

Suggests potential coder connections based on mutual friends, shared interests, and activity.

Implements graph-based logic and cosine similarity to find relevant users.

2. 📄 Pages You May Like
Recommends coding-related pages, groups, or events.

Based on user's interests, interactions, and demographic similarities.

Uses content-based filtering and clustering (KMeans) for segmentation.

3. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Cleans and preprocesses user data (e.g., missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formatting).

Normalizes and encodes data for efficient model performance.

Ensures the dataset is ready for ML model training and evaluation.
